This is a calculator program that takes algebraic input. It is not
very well written; I wrote it in a few hours before it was due! It
contains a fair ammount of spaghetti code! It works by using a method
that I found in the C++ programming book by Stroustrup. This version
is written in C and requires linux-- for example, on line 71 of calc.c,
it uses a special flag in the scanf call, "m", which only works on linux
(and some other posix unix thingies).

scanf("%ms", &workingArray); This allocates memory for an input string
automatically so you don't need to mess with malloc.

The calculator splits an input into different types of sub-inputs
recursively. I think the book called this lexographic or something like
that. It recurses down until it can do evaluation of expressions and
then goes back up to eventually return an answer.

A simpler way that everyone else used was by just taking an input
string and converting it into reverse polish notation and executing
the operations with a stack. Technically this does the same thing but
with recursion.
